# Configuration file specification: R3 Corda
A network.yaml file is the base configuration file for setting up a Corda DLT network. This file contains all the information related to the infrastructure and network specifications. Here is the structure of it.
![](./../_static/TopLevelClass.png)

Before setting up a Corda DLT network, this file needs to be updated with the required specifications.
The configurations are grouped in the following sections for better understanding.

* type

* version

* frontend

* docker

* orderers

* organizations

`type` defines the platform information viz corda/fabric.
`version` defines the version of platform being used.
`frontend` is a flag which defines if frontend is enabled for nodes or not.

`docker` section contains the credentials of the repository where all the required images are built and stored.
(Note: Please use the [NMS Jenkins file](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework/tree/master/automation/r3-corda/NMS.Jenkinsfile) or/and [Doorman Jenkins file](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework/tree/master/automation/r3-corda/Doorman.Jenkinsfile) to build and store the docker images before running the Ansible playbooks)
